Physical Devices

Device 1:
        HP Laptop
        Processor: Intel(R)Core(TM) i7-1065G7 @ 1.30GHz 
        RAM: 32GB
        BasedBoard: HP 86c9
        GPU: Intel Iris Plus Graphics
        OS: Windows 10 home
        System Type: x64-Based PC

Device 1 is the main machine I use for everyday web browsing, studying cyber security and work related projects. Currently

Device 2: 
        Custom Built Gaming PC turned virtual machine host
        Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4470k @ 3.50GHz
        RAM: 16GB DDR3
        BaseBoard: ASUS Z87-k
        GPU: GeForce GTX 770
        OS: Windows 10 Home
        System Type: x64-Based PC
        
Device 2 is currently used to host virtual machines. At the moment it hosts 1 attack machine and whatever vulnerable box I am working through. 
Overall this device serves as a more Sandbox environment for me to work in that, if need be, can easily be wiped and restored with out losing too much data in the process

Device 3:
        Lenovo Ideapad P400 Touch
        Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3230M @2.60GHz
        RAM: 6.0 GB
        BaseBoard: Lenovo ??? (listed as invalid)
        GPU:Intel HD graphics 4000
        OS: Windows 10 HOME
        System Type x64-Based PC

Device 3 currently doesn't have much of a use that I have come up with for it. I may put some obscure version of linux on it just to play around with. 
May not hurt to just have an extra device to plug into the home lab network One day so I'll be keeping it around for now.

Device4:
        ASUS Nexus 7 Tablet
        Processor: Nvidia-Tegra3 @ 1.2Ghz 
        RAM: 2gg
        BaseBoard: ASUS NEXUS 7 1ST GEN 7" ME370TG
        GPU: Doubt it has one
        OS: Android 6.01
        System Type: 
        
Device 4 really has no purpose, or use. It's really just something I picked up for cheap because I had never seen kali run on a table and I thought it was a cool idea. 
Again it never really hurts to keep an extra device or two around to connect to your home lab network

Device 5:
        ASUS RT-AX58U Dual band wifi router
        
Pretty self explanitory but this is the router I use to connect my homelab to the internet.

R-dev 1:
        Dell laptop

        GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GT
        OS: Kali Linux

overall not a bad device I suppose, just old and slow. Not really sure what I'd do with it though
